## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**My name is Simran Kaur** and I am a data scientist with a consulting background in banking and a recent Flatiron School graduate. With a background in risk management and metrics reporting, I have consulted for three different top-tier financial institutions where I have honed my skills in identifying and mitigating operational risk incidents. I have experience in creating and maintaining case logs, coordinating with various teams, developing metrics and reporting, and presenting findings to senior management.

I became a data scientist because I am a storyteller. I also enjoy puzzles. Data science allows me to use data to solve complex problems, all while telling a story.

### What I'm up to:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently sharpening my SQL skills.
- ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaborating on data and machine learning projects that tell interesting stories and/or have a social impact. 
- ðŸ—½ Based in NYC
- ðŸ¥… Goal: Participate in a dance competition.
